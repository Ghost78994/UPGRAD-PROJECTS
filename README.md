CASE STUDIES AND PROJECTS
Digitally enabled customers like to shop on the run, and that is the reason why online shopping is one of the most popular online activities worldwide. In 2019, global e-commerce sales amounted to 3.53 trillion USD and are projected to grow to 6.54 trillion USD in 2022.
For this project we would be computing various KEY PERFORMANCE KPI'S for an e-commerce company, RetailCorp Inc.
Following are the tasks performed for the project:
1.Reading the sales data from the Kafka server
2.Preprocessing the data to calculate additional derived columns such as total_cost etc
3.Calculating the time-based KPIs and time and country-based KPIs
4.Storing the KPIs (both time-based and time- and country-based) for a 10-minute interval into separate JSON files for further analysis
